# Machine Learning with Python

## Overview

This repository contains the projects and lecture notes from the "Machine Learning with Python" certification course I completed on freeCodeCamp. Through this course, I gained a solid foundation in machine learning concepts and practical experience by completing various projects.

## Projects

During the course, I completed the following five projects:

1. **Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator**
   - **Description**: Developed a linear regression model to predict health insurance costs based on features such as age, BMI, and smoking status.
   - **Skills Gained**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, linear regression, evaluation metrics.

2. **Neural Network SMS Text Classifier**
   - **Description**: Implemented a neural network to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam).
   - **Skills Gained**: Text preprocessing, neural network architecture, model training and evaluation.

3. **Book Recommendation Engine using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - **Description**: Created a book recommendation engine using the KNN algorithm to suggest books based on user preferences.
   - **Skills Gained**: Collaborative filtering, KNN algorithm, data similarity measures, recommendation systems.

4. **Cat and Dog Image Classifier**
   - **Description**: Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs.
   - **Skills Gained**: Image processing, deep learning, CNN architecture, model training and evaluation.

5. **Rock Paper Scissors**
   - **Description**: Developed a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match. This was the most challenging project.
   - **Skills Gained**: Game theory, strategy development, machine learning for game play, model testing and optimization.

## Skills Acquired

Throughout the course and the completion of these projects, I acquired the following skills:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and transforming raw data into suitable formats for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
- **Model Building**: Implementing and training various machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE) to assess model performance.
- **Deep Learning**: Understanding and applying deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- **Natural Language Processing**: Techniques for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and building models for text classification and sentiment analysis.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Developing collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation systems.
- **Game Strategy Development**: Applying machine learning and strategic thinking to develop game-playing algorithms.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating informative visualizations to communicate data insights and model results.

## Conclusion

Completing this course on freeCodeCamp has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of machine learning principles and practical experience in building and evaluating models. The projects showcased in this repository demonstrate my ability to apply these skills to real-world problems.
